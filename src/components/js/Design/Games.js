                    Like album art, game art crosses over different disciplines but ultimately requires the skills that come with digital image editing tools.
                    Much of this is a newer experience for me but it ranges from designing sprite sheets to 3D model texturing.
                    Below I have included examples of textures I have done for an unreleased 2.5D side scrolling game.
                    I have also included a sample sprite sheet for an ongoing project which focuses on hand drawn animations rather than pixel art.

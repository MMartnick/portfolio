                     During my Associate degree program, I had majored in Digital/Multimedia and Information Resources Design where I had studied in practice various facets of design with the Adobe Suite. 
                    While it was highly focused on user experience/user interface design, the program also covered graphic design for print along with audio/video editing.  
                    While in the program I found that I enjoyed logo design and actively sought out freelance work designing logos for small businesses and individuals.

             My experience in web development covers several different technologies.
             My background is heavily development in the MERN stack, and I received a corresponding certification from the University of Texas in Austin in 2018.
             However, I have also crossed into other areas as well and while I excel in frontend development I have worked in backend.
             Some of those technologies include Java with the JSP framework on the corporate level, Angular 2+, Apache server, and some of the Microsoft Office Suite of development tools like Access and SharePoint.
